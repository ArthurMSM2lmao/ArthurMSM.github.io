        console.log("I made this website for fun, i started it by making ChatGPT shit out a HTML at gunpoint, then i reached out for Koru, he helped me a lot with this website, but then i started to remember, an old friend in fact, i had manipulated him, and made him go through a lot, even a panic attack, that happened due to the fact that i was around 10, i started fealing jealous or something, so i got mad at him, and as previously stated, manipulated him. I don't know what was wrong with me, but i feel bad for doing such thing, i hope he is all right.");
        console.log("I also felt anger after that, i wanted to be his friend, but then i thought to myself: if i can't reach him through discord nor his e-mail, i might aswell reach him by sending stuff to him.")
        console.log("Fun fact! the original version of this website had an IP Grabber, but then i got absolutely demolished by Redox, Shoutout to him for making me look like a dumbass, in fact i was lmao, the code was actually public because im using github, i was gonna use the IP Grabber to get the location of my old friend but i simply did not have any connections to him.")
        console.log("I feel some anger when i think of him, some sadness, i feel happy also, i don't know what i feel, he was a nice friend to me, but i pushed him away.")
        console.log("I'd love to be able to talk to him again, he was my best friend after all.")
        console.log("Imma be honest, i was homophobic to him in many ways, he first was straight, then he decided he was gay, then Bisexual, then Pansexual and finally he settled with Bisexual.")
        console.log("I also hated his Boyfriend, i don't know, i am not homophobic normally, i just thought it was stupid, i don't know how to explain.")
        console.log("One day i told one of his friends that i thought that it was stupid to have the name of your lover on your profile, status, whatever!")
        console.log("I wanted to implement another IP Grabber on this website, but i would be endangering other people's info with this, i tell you what, if my IP Grabber got a bunch of IP's and someone got inside the webhook, it would be a disaster.")
        console.log("I also dedicated a lot of time into writing these logs, i'll probably stop updating these but i think its a good secret for anyone who goes inside the files of this website, console")
        console.log("Also if i kept the IP Grabber and it happens to grab your ip, only you or i could stop it, i mean, its github after all.")
        console.log("And Thank you so much, for reading these logs, and remember, i love you <3")
